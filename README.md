# My C Journey
## This is almost all my C/C++ files that I've worked on while in university.



There are several types of folder. 

* First type is the online judges folder prefixed by OJ_ . These are the online judges I've used to practice my problem solving.
* Second type is the folders I've used for my own practice and bug fixes, these are the Tests, Tricks, Learn folders
* Third type is the outside code folders, these are the folders that have mostly codes that I didn't write. Like: External, Programming Contest Book, Remember_solution etc
* The next type is the contest, seasons types, These are the periodic solutions that I needed to do from time to time.


## Things to revise for every language the terms I use here is c++ specific
* Convert string to int/double, convert int/double to string
* Vector/list's declare, size, push/append, how to empty, insert at any position, is double linked or single.
* Stack's size, is empty, clear, push, pop, top
* how to declare long long
* how to do foreach loop


## How to setup environment
### C++
* Install C/C++ extension >> ms-vscode.cpptools
* Go to a .cpp file and on the top left select the down arrow on the RHS of the play buttno and select `Run File`
* If a configuration panel is shown, select the C++ option.

This will add a `tasks.json` file in the .vscode folder

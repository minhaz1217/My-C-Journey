# My C Journey
## This is almost all my C/C++ files that I've worked on while in university.



There are several types of folder. 

* First type is the online judges folder prefixed by OJ_ . These are the online judges I've used to practice my problem solving.
* Second type is the folders I've used for my own practice and bug fixes, these are the Tests, Tricks, Learn folders
* Third type is the outside code folders, these are the folders that have mostly codes that I didn't write. Like: External, Programming Contest Book, Remember_solution etc
* The next type is the contest, seasons types, These are the periodic solutions that I needed to do from time to time.

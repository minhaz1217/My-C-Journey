If there is nod A and B.

And if a edge between them A---B.

What will happen after split A and B .

```
After slit A , we will get A ---> A' (Directed, cost 1)
After slit B , we will get B ---> B' (Directed, cost 1) 
```

After that.

```
A' ---> B (Directed ,cost 1);
B' ---> A (Directed ,cost 1);
```
